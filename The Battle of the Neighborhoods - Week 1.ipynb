The definition of a high-end cafe is one that caters to the upper-middle to upper financial class of society. Goods and services will have a premium that is justified by the high quality in comparison to general cafes. Products from the cafe such as baked goods and beverages will be created by distinguished bakers and dessert chefs. The ingredients used will have a greater focus on quality than on affordability. As the economy thrives and a larger number of people realize a personal taste for premium services and goods, intelligent investors will be looking for locales that cater to a higher echelon of society (financially). It is innate human nature that people with greater than average buying power are willing to pay a greater premium for exclusivity. The Foursquare location data will be vital to determining locations that are dense, wealthy residential neighborhoods that lack establishments of a similar nature. The greater the competition, the less appealing a certain location will be.

This will enable me to make an educated decision on which neighborhoods to filter out and which ones are prime candidates based on market availability. Another source I will use is median household income data per zipcode in Houston. This table also contains population per zipcode as well as specific latitude and longitude information (location). Knowing this, I can determine which neighborhoods have the most residents with the ability to afford the products and services my establishment will be offering, and which neighborhoods I will have to filter out due to a lower level of buying power. Coupling this location/financial data with the Foursquare data I will be able to cluster specific zipcodes/neighborhoods within Houston that are the most ideal candidates for beginning a upscale cafe business.
